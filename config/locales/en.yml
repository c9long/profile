  about_me:
    description:
      I'm Chris, a fourth year computer science student at the University
      of Waterloo. As a software developer, I'm passionate about creating efficient
      and scalable applications, and love working across the entire stack. My expertise
      lies in Ruby on Rails, Cloud infrastructure, and C#/.NET development. I've worked
      extensively in the cybersecurity umbrella, with a focus on implementing various
      identity and access management strategies for user authentication. As a site
      reliability engineer, my expertise lies primarily in synthetic monitoring, Moogsoft
      alerts integration, API and secrets storage, and Kubernetes maintenance. I enjoy
      solving complex problems and continuously learning new skills to enhance my
      craft.
    free_time:
      In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, working on personal projects,
      playing golf, building computers, and spending time with friends and family.
      I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.
